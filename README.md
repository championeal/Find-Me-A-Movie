Title: Find-Me-A-Movie
Author: Neal Sheehan
Installation: simply download .zip file

Pitch:
Sometimes I find myself spending hours looking for the ‘perfect’ movie to watch. I do not want to waste my time watching any bad movies, but I end up wasting tons of time just searching for the right one. Then, just when I think I have found the movie I want to watch, I cannot find it on any of the popular streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc.). The entire process of searching starts over again and the time starts to add up. Sometimes I even decide it is not worth it to keep looking for a movie and I just give up my search. This is not how the movie watching process should be. The movie watching experience should be enjoyable and great movies should be easy to find.

Features:
- Search movies
- Stores ratings and watchlist
